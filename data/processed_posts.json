It hurt deeply. But now, when things don't go as planned, I don't panic.\n\nI don't question my worth. I sit back, breathe, and trust. The Universe knows.\n\nI know there's another plan waiting. Something bigger, better, and just for me.\n\nTo anyone feeling the weight of rejection: trust that the closed doors are protecting you from something you can't see right now.\n\nYour path is being cleared for something even more beautiful.",

They don't need a fancy title or a famous brand behind them to prove their worth.\n\nI've seen the other side too—people in top-tier companies feeling lost, overwhelmed, or stuck, even though the world sees them as 'successful'.\n\nLet's stop attaching someone's value to the company they work for. Freshers especially need to hear this—skills are what matter, not the size of the company behind them.\n\nAt the end of the day, happiness and growth don't come from a brand name, they come from doing what you love and constantly improving your craft.",
